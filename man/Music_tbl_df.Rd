\title{Music Recognition Learning in Identical Twins}
\format{
A tibble with 12 observations and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{method1}{Improvement scores using the first music recognition technique (integer).}
  \item{method2}{Improvement scores using the second music recognition technique (integer).}
  \item{differ}{Difference in improvement scores between the two methods (integer).}
}
}
\source{
The dataset was taken from the BSDA package.

\usage{
data(Music_tbl_df)
}
\description{
This dataset, Music_tbl_df, is a tibble containing improvement scores for identical twins
taught music recognition using two different techniques. Each pair of twins was taught using
both methods, and the differences in their improvement scores were recorded.
